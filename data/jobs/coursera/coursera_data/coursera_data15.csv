Vous aurez ainsi des bases solides pour créer votre entreprise high tech ou décider d'en rejoindre une.

Décider de créer ou de rejoindre une entreprise technologique dans ses premières années est la promesse d’une aventure hors du commun mais ce n’est pas un acte anodin : il faut être capable d’accepter que toutes les « bonnes » idées ne conduiront pas au succès, que seule une minorité de projets débouchera sur un immense succès. Il faut aussi renverser votre rapport à l’échec, qui est une source d’expérience et doit être géré selon la logique de la « perte acceptable » : l’entrepreneur aime l’incertitude, pas le risque démesuré. La création d’entreprises technologiques vous offre une réelle occasion de contribuer à changer le monde mais nécessite que vous adoptiez un certain état d’esprit et que vous puissiez acquérir des savoirs, des savoir-faire et des savoir être, ainsi qu’une expérience la plus large possible.

Vous aurez l'occasion de côtoyer des personnes passionnantes et passionnées issues d'horizons très différents. A partir d’une vision et d’une technologie de pointe, ces femmes et ces hommes ont souvent bâti des entreprises d’envergure mondiale.

La trajectoire de développement d'une entreprise technologique est pleine d’imprévus qui vous demanderont à la fois de l’agilité et une préparation importante pour partir d’une idée forte, sélectionner votre marché, développer votre offre, réunir une équipe à la hauteur des enjeux et trouver des financements.

Ce cours se compose de sessions méthodologiques ainsi que de témoignages d'entrepreneurs et d’acteurs emblématiques de la création d'entreprises technologiques. Vous pourrez ainsi vous familiariser avec les dilemmes essentiels auxquels sont confrontés les créateurs d'une entreprise high tech, à commencer par la décision de créer sa propre structure, qui représente un véritable choix de vie. 

Vous verrez également que la création d'une entreprise technologique est davantage une aventure collective qu’un parcours individuel.","Created by:  École Polytechnique, HEC Paris","['Taught by:\xa0\xa0Romain Beaume, Chargé Mission chaire MIX', 'Taught by:\xa0\xa0Etienne Krieger, Affiliate Professor']",Rated 4.6 out of 5 of 226 ratings,See all 71 reviews,2018-05-30,"['Home', 'Business', 'Entrepreneurship']",Créer et développer une startup technologique,https://www.coursera.org/learn/startup-technologique

In fact, due to the extraordinary growth of the cloud, it has been described as a tornado, not a fluffy white floating object!

Commercial research analysts consider cloud as one of the most significant trends with a potential to change the whole global IT industry.  Governments, including those in the US, Britain, and Australia, have cloud-first policies now in place which mandate cloud over non-cloud services in ICT procurement.  But CIOs and other senior executives, while it's on the majority of their agendas, aren't sure what it really means for their organisations - how to leverage the benefits, control the commercials, manage the business risk, and adapt their organisations.  

While it is important to set requirements, negotiate commercials (terms, service level agreements, and pricing), and sign the contract - it is also critical that we develop a clear plan for ‘Moving to the Cloud’ which realigns our business architecture, organization and most importantly our people.
This course provides the answers that management must know to be successful and realise the benefits:

•	Where should I go cloud? 
•	What are the commercials?
•	Where is my leverage?
•	How do I realign my business practices and architecture?
•	How do I gear up my people and structure my organisation?

Why is producing milk efficiently and sustainably so important? 

Milk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?

Most milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.

In this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.

Course lectures are translated into Portuguese and Chinese; PDF files of these translations can be found under each course week.

Are these modes incompatible? Put another way: is the intellectually responsible thing to do to ‘pick sides’ and identify with one of these approaches at the exclusion of others? Or, are they complementary or mutually supportive? As is typical of questions of such magnitude, the devil is in the details. For example, it is important to work out what is really distinctive about each of these ways of inquiring about the world. In order to gain some clarity here, we’ll be investigating what some of the current leading thinkers in philosophy, science and religion are actually doing.

This course, entitled ‘Philosophy and Religion’, is the second of three related courses in our Philosophy, Science and Religion Online series, and in this course we will ask important questions about the age-old debate between science and religion, such as:
 
•  What kind of conflicts are there between religion and science?
•  Does current cognitive science of religion effectively explain away God?
•  If there is a God who has made us so that we can know him, why do some people not believe?
•  Is belief in science also a kind of fundamentalism?
•  What makes us good at getting, giving, or sharing, knowledge? Is this different when it is religious knowledge?

The first course in the Philosophy, Science and Religion series, 'Science and Philosophy' was launched early in 2017 and you can sign up to it at any time. The third course —‘Religion and Science’—will be launched early in 2018. Completing all three courses will give you a broader understanding of this fascinating topic. Look for: 

• Philosophy, Science and Religion I: Science and Philosophy https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy-science-religion-1/
• Philosophy, Science and Religion III: Religion and Science

Upon successful completion of all three courses, students will:

(1) Understand the main parameters at stake in the current debate between science and religion.
(2) Have some familiarity with the relevant areas of science that feature in the debate—including cosmology, evolution, and the neurosciences—and will have begun to engage with them conceptually.
(3) Have encountered key philosophical approaches to the interface between science and religion, and will have had the opportunity to engage them in practice.
(4) Have embarked constructively in cross-disciplinary conversations.
(5) Have demonstrated an openness to personal growth through a commitment to dialogue across intellectual and spiritual boundaries.

This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat.

In the first half of the course, we investigate DNA replication, and ask the question, where in the genome does DNA replication begin?  We will see that we can answer this question for many bacteria using only some straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages in the genome.

In the second half of the course, we examine a different biological question, when we ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks.  The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again, we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for, we can start to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA.  Perhaps surprisingly, we will apply randomized algorithms, which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems.

Finally, you will get your hands dirty and apply existing software tools to find recurring biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium tuberculosis go ""dormant"" within a host for many years before causing an active infection.",Created by:  University of California San Diego,"['Taught by:\xa0\xa0Pavel  Pevzner, Professor', 'Taught by:\xa0\xa0Phillip Compeau, Visiting Researcher']",Rated 4.7 out of 5 of 317 ratings,See all 66 reviews,2018-05-30,"['Home', 'Life Sciences', 'Bioinformatics']",Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I),https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis

Planet Earth presents an overview of several aspects of our home, from a geological perspective.  We begin with earthquakes—what they are, what causes them, what effects they have, and what we can do about them. We will emphasize that plate tectonics—the grand unifying theory of geology—explains how the map of our planet's surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why present-day geologic activity—including a variety of devastating natural disasters such as earthquakes—occur where they do.  We consider volcanoes, types of eruptions, and typical rocks found there.

Do I cross the road now, or wait for the oncoming truck to pass? Should I eat fries or a salad for lunch? How much should I tip the cab driver? We usually make these decisions with almost no thought, using what psychologists call “heuristics” – rules of thumb that enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors – predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don’t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer’s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?

Behavioral finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause them. In this course, we examine these predictable errors, and discover where we are most susceptible to them. This course is intended to guide participants towards better financial choices.
