It is meant to introduce you to this topic in well-structured, clear and easy to understand ways. Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways?  The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.

As a participant, you will:
- Watch videos that demonstrate natural phenomena and the Exploratorium's approach to teaching and learning 
- Conduct personal investigations by engaging in hands-on activities based in those phenomena
- Reflect and share your experience doing activities
- Discuss and identify challenges and opportunities for teaching
- Devise a lesson of your own based on one or more of the activities

We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course. 

We use a traditional, if overly simplistic, way of grouping Buddhist philosophical systems and ritual-contemplative practices into “three vehicles”, three programs of theory and practice supporting the personal journey from suffering to enlightenment. This scheme became normative in India and Tibet: (i) the Lesser Vehicle (Hīnayāna), (ii) the Great Vehicle (Mahāyāna), and (iii) the Adamantine Vehicle (Vajrayāna), also referred to as “esoteric Buddhism” or “Buddhist tantra”. To this, we will add a fourth Vehicle which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”. We follow an indigenous Tibetan tradition in terms of characterizing each with a specific orientational paradigm - repression, refinement, transformation, and natural freedom. These twelve meditative traditions constitute the framework for the course’s discussion of the main streams of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.

The five modules of the present course, dedicated to ""Lesser Vehicle"" practices and perspectives, treat the first five of these twelve types. Each module in turn has four components: (i) the specific Buddhist meditation in its traditional presentation and practice; (ii) modern scientific research into its efficacy and dynamics, or on practices, principles, and processes related to this type of meditation in our analysis; (iii) the fact, problems, and opportunities of modern secular adaptations in a variety of educational, professional, and personal settings; and (iv) secular practices for experimentation, which are either direct adaptations or new practices designed to give an experiential sense of some of the principles underlying the Buddhist meditative practice.",Created by:  University of Virginia,"['Taught by:\xa0\xa0Prof. David Francis Germano, Professor', 'Taught by:\xa0\xa0Kurtis R.

Hence, their reliability and dependability increasingly depends on software. Defects can be fatal and extremely costly (with regards to mass-production of products and safety-critical systems).

First, a model of the real system has to be built. In the simplest case, the model reflects all possible states that the system can reach and all possible transitions between states in a (labelled) State Transition System. When adding probabilities and discrete time to the model, we are dealing with so-called Discrete-time Markov chains which in turn can be extended with continuous timing to Continuous-time Markov chains. Both formalisms have been used widely for modeling and performance and dependability evaluation of computer and communication systems in a wide variety of domains. These formalisms are well understood, mathematically attractive while at the same time flexible enough to model complex systems. 

Model checking focuses on the qualitative evaluation of the model. As formal verification method, model checking analyzes
the functionality of the system model. A property that needs to be analyzed has to be specified in a logic with consistent syntax and semantics. For every state of the model, it is then checked whether the property is valid or not.
The main focus of this course is on quantitative model checking for Markov chains, for which we will discuss efficient computational algorithms. The learning objectives of this course are as follows:

- Express dependability properties for different kinds of transition systems .
- Compute the evolution over time for Markov chains.
- Check whether single states satisfy a certain formula and compute the satisfaction set for properties.",Created by:  EIT Digital ,"['Taught by:\xa0\xa0Anne Remke, Prof. dr.']",Rated 4.2 out of 5 of 21 ratings,See all 4 reviews,2018-05-30,"['Home', 'Computer Science', 'Software Development']",Quantitative Model Checking,https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-model-checking

Welcome to this on-demand MOOC “In the footsteps of Zika… approaching the unknown”. 

This MOOC has been produced by Université de Genève (www.unige.ch), Institut Pasteur (www.pasteur.fr), Université Paris Descartes (www.parisdescartes.fr) and Centre Virchow-Villermé (virchowvillerme.eu).

With the help of the intervention of faculty members and international experts, we will explore together the recent Zika phenomenon, a previously rare benign virus that recently turned unexpectedly into the limelight when on the 1st of February 2016 it was declared by the WHO as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 
As this outbreak is still ongoing and under close investigation, this MOOC has the opportunity to be an open learning experience that will follow the marked developments and new discoveries over time. This MOOC will bring you to the heart of the Zika outbreak and invite you to this adventure in uncharted territories. 
Moreover, we invite you to join the interactive dialogue among participants and facilitators through a community of practice, which promotes questions, critical thinking, participatory learning, as well as interrelated and ongoing collaborative information. 
Let us learn hand in hand all together to go further in finding clues and eventually solutions!

Course description 

This interdisciplinary course is divided into 8 modules available in 4 languages (subtitles in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish). 
Each module is organized around a central topic that will help those who take the course to develop their skills and knowledge. Each module provides
- interviews with specialists
- quizes
- recommended readings
- online videos and web links. 

This MOOC will cover a range of topics, such as epidemiology, historical and geographical dispersion of the virus and its vectors through globalization and climate change, its modes of transmission, but also the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. The different types of preventive measures will be also covered. 
A special module will focus on possible neurological adverse effects such as the risk for birth defects (microcephaly) in pregnant women, while another one will examine the peripheral nerve paralysis called the Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
The fact that Zika presents a significant threat to political and economic stabilities and thus reinforces social inequity through South America will be addressed. 
The revolution in cultural, religious, and legal norms in front of the expansion of Zika will be also debated. 
Finally, the last two modules will state the role, recommendations and response measures of policy makers and public health organizations under the light of medias.",Created by:  University of Geneva,"['Taught by:\xa0\xa0Antoine Flahault, Professor of Public Health and Director of the Institute of Global Health (Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva)  and co-Director of Centre Virchow-Villermé (Université Paris Descartes)', 'Taught by:\xa0\xa0Aline Philibert (In Partnership with UNIGE), Assistant Professor', 'Taught by:\xa0\xa0Arnaud Fontanet (in Partnership with UNIGE), Director Center for Global Health – Head of Emerging Diseases Epidemiology Unit', 'Taught by:\xa0\xa0Henri-Jean Philippe (In Partnership with UNIGE), Gynecologist, Obstetrician - Head of Department at the Hôpital Cochin']",Rated 4.7 out of 5 of 81 ratings,See all 25 reviews,2018-05-30,"['Home', 'Life Sciences', 'Medicine and Healthcare']",In the footsteps of Zika… approaching the unknown,https://www.coursera.org/learn/zika

Over four weeks of lectures, this advanced course considers how to design interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making and voting systems), mechanism design, and auctions.

In the first week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which proves that there is no ""perfect"" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain ""mechanism design"" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an introduction to auction theory.

This is the first of the sequence of two courses. It develops the fundamental concepts in linear spaces, linear operators, matrix representations and basic tools for calculations with systems of equations. The course is designed with a “content based” emphasis, answering the “why” and “where“ of the topics, as much as the traditional “what” and  “how” leading to “definitions” and “proofs”.

Chapter 1: Place and Contents of Linear Algebra Cebirin
Chapter 2: Learning From Vectors in the Plane
Chapter 3: Learning From Equations For Two Unknowns
Chapter 4: Linear Spaces
Chapter 5: Function Spaces and Fourier Series

You will learn to see your community or country as a complex social-ecological system and to describe its water, energy and food metabolism in the form of a pattern, as well as to map the categories of social actors.  
We will provide you with the tools to measure the nexus elements and to analyze them in a coherent way across scales and dimensions of analysis. In this way, your quantitative analysis will become useful for informed decision-making. You will be able to detect and quantify dependence on non-renewable resources and externalization of environmental problems to other societies and ecosystems (a popular ‘solution’ in the western world).  Practical case studies, from both developed and developing countries, will help you evaluate the state-of-play of a given community or country and to evaluate possible solutions. Last but not least, you will learn to see pressing social-ecological issues, such as energy poverty, water scarcity and inequity, from a radically different perspective, and to question everything you’ve been told so far.
