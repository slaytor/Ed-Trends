          Philosophy of psychology, among whose issues we will cover the evolution of the human mind and the nature of consciousness.

           Philosophy of neurosciences, where we’ll consider the nature of human cognition and the relation between mind, machines, and the environment.


 Learning objectives

Gain a fairly well-rounded view on selected areas and topics at the intersection of philosophy and the sciences

Understand some key questions, and conceptual problems arising in the cognitive sciences.

Develop critical skills to evaluate and assess these problems.

After developing a broad understanding of accounting and financial statements, you will begin to develop a more nuanced understanding of individual components of doing business, such as making a sale or building inventory.  By considering many of the more common actions of a company, you will build your understanding of accounting, and explore these concepts by applying them across various types of transactions. Once you understand these individual concepts better, you will be ready to return to the overall financial statements and use them as informational tools, including building ratios.

Answer: CAD software tools.  Learn how to build thesA modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer: a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. Our focus in this first part of the course is on key Boolean logic representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, the gate-level logic in these designs.  This is the first step of the design chain, as we move from logic to layout.    Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: Computational Boolean algebra, logic verification, and logic synthesis (2-level and multi-level).

Recommended Background
Programming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Exposure to basic VLSI at an undergraduate level is nice -- but it’s not necessary.  We will keep the course self-contained, but students with some VLSI will be able to skip some background material.e tools in this class.",Created by:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,"['Taught by:\xa0\xa0Rob A.

Knowledge linking genomics to health and disease is rapidly expanding. Translation of this knowledge into clinical and public health practice offers promising opportunities but also raises a host of ethical, legal, social, and policy questions.  Using case examples, this inter-disciplinary course will explore the challenges of genomic and precision medicine.

This seven week, inter-disciplinary course provides an introduction to ethical, legal, social, and policy issues that arise in the translation of genomic knowledge into medical and public health practice. It considers challenges in health related and reproductive testing/screening focusing on six specific areas:
•	Pre‐conception genetic diagnosis, and prenatal testing/screening 
•	Newborn screening 
•	Use of genomic sequencing technologies to diagnose and predict disease 
•	Targeting genomic testing/screening by race/ethnicity 
•	Direct‐to‐consumer genomic testing/screening 
•	Use of “big data” for genomic research and genomic translation 

Course Objectives 

1.	Critique the promise of genomics and precision medicine for improving health outcomes for individuals and populations. 
2.	Through analysis of key cases, demonstrate an understanding of the ethical, legal, social, and policy (ELSI) challenges that accompany the translation of new genomic knowledge into clinical medicine and public health practice. 
3.	Apply a critical analysis of ELSI concerns to your professional practice (if relevant), your interest as a potential user of genomic knowledge, and as a citizen with a responsibility to shape health policy.","Created by:  University of California, San Francisco","['Taught by:\xa0\xa0Wylie Burke, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Bioethics and Humanities, University of Washington', 'Taught by:\xa0\xa0Barbara A.

Another important task of this course is to provide the deep understanding of the difference between cultural and symbolic meaning products (such as films, recorded music, book and periodicals, online media content etc) and other kind of goods. 

This course will help you to: 
  - Identify main peculiarities of cultural and symbolic goods in their difference with other branches of economy in terms of production chain, risks, relationship between different stages of production. 
  - Be able to analyze cultural products and symbolic goods from the organizational, economic, business model point of view.
  - Be able to invent new business models and analyze cultural products in terms of their productions risk.  
  - Be able to analyze cultural policies and creative industries/clusters policies.

Main prerequisite to this course is to be able to produce analytical texts in humanities. Normally the course addresses all students of master level interested in peculiarities of media and cultural economy and management. This course is strongly not recommended for those who:
  - Analyse any market or industry only in microeconomic terms (supply and demand, level of competitions etc). This course is not about market but about peculiarities of symbolic goods;
  - Try to interpret culture only in terms of marketing and management (i.e. culture is considered like a simple good to be sold to the consumer). This course considers it more broadly like a human agency to produce meanings of everyday life. That’s why cultural goods are different and can not be interpreted exclusively in terms of consuming and need more or less state support;
  - Try to interpret culture like pure “art” and consequently are absolutely not preoccupied by organizational aspect of its working.

Political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing, and sometimes even dangerous. And whether it’s Christian fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, or militant atheism, religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance, dogma, and ignorance. The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.

But what is intellectual humility, anyway? And why do people seem so drawn toward intellectual arrogance? Psychologists, philosophers, theologians, and educationalists are now suggesting some answers.

In this course we try to define intellectual humility and intellectual virtues in general, and ask how we know who is humble. All lectures are delivered by leading specialists, and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life.

This course is a part of a series which explores the theory, the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility (the latter two coming in June and November 2017). Completing all three courses will give you a broader understanding of this fascinating topic. Look for:
