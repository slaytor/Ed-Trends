This is evidenced by the popularity of MapReduce and Hadoop, and most recently Apache Spark, a fast, in-memory distributed collections framework written in Scala. In this course, we'll see how the data parallel paradigm can be extended to the distributed case, using Spark throughout. We'll cover Spark's programming model in detail, being careful to understand how and when it differs from familiar programming models, like shared-memory parallel collections or sequential Scala collections. Through hands-on examples in Spark and Scala, we'll learn when important issues related to distribution like latency and network communication should be considered and how they can be addressed effectively for improved performance.

Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:

- read data from persistent storage and load it into Apache Spark,
- manipulate data with Spark and Scala,
- express algorithms for data analysis in a functional style, 
- recognize how to avoid shuffles and recomputation in Spark,

Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.

In this capstone project, you are tasked with applying the concepts learned throughout the specialization, to create your own toolbox designed with the ELL in Mind. 

In this two-part capstone, you will first create an annotated lesson plan comprising both formative and summative assessments.  The lesson plan will include any modified materials for ELLs such as graphic organizers or writing frames pertinent to the lesson's activities. The annotation will include a rationale for lesson elements based on information presented in Lesson Planning with the ELL in Mind and Assessing Achievement with the ELL in Mind. 

Second, you will use your checklist of resources, personalized to your school and community, to create an engagement plan of action.  This should include specific milestones for creating a more engaging environment for your students and their families. You will also include a rationale for elements of engagement based on information presented in Engaging the ELL and Their Families in the School and Community.

In this capstone, you will create a personalized toolbox for ELL success in the content classroom.  

This toolbox will include:
   * Annotated Lesson Plan
       - Modified Materials
       - Formative and Summative Assessment
       - Lesson Plan and Materials Rationale
   * Engagement Action Plan and Rationale

The materials created in this project should be immediately useful in your classroom.  Your capstone project should be tailored to your teaching context, content area, and students. 

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
     * Design a lesson plan with attention to the needs of your ELLs

Due to this cause or another, it’s a huge stress to look at most Powerpoint slides. Depending on the “design” skills of the speaker and audience’s taste slides create different emotions from a slight annoyance to physical sickness.

But that is not the worst thing. The worst thing is that instead of improving the presentation such slides confuse the audience, distract it and finally oblige the speaker to explain them rather than being quite self-explanatory.

The goal of this course is to change that by equipping learners with a set of tools to create simple, clear and aesthetic slides which improve the presentation of the speaker. The course covers universal design principles, templates, colors, typefaces, slides’ typography, use of photos and pictograms, composition rules and ways to create clear and meaningful charts and diagrams.

By successfully undertaking the Capstone, learners will accomplish three main goals: 1. They will hone their writing, design, and speaking skills and build a portfolio for a job search and/or professional application; 2. They will shape these skills into a unique brand identity; and, if they choose, 3. They will undertake a transformative effect in the world around them.
