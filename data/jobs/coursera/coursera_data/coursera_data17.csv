It looks like the end of the world may be at hand. There is a black hole in the sky where the sun should be. Pink flames of solar prominences and long silver streamers of the sun's corona stretch across the sky. It gets cold, and animals do strange things. People scream and shout and cheer, and remember the experience their whole life.  But total eclipses are important scientifically as well. They let us see parts of the sun’s atmosphere that are otherwise invisible. A total eclipse presented the first chance to test Einstein’s prediction that matter can bend space – like near a black hole. The best total eclipse in the United States in 40 years happens August 21st, 2017.  

This course has two primary goals: 

1) to get you excited for the total solar eclipse coming in August 2017 and prepare you and your community to safely view it 
2) to provide an inviting overview of the science of the sun and the physics of light

If you are most interested in preparing for the eclipse, you can hop right into Week 5! If you want the full course experience, and to get some fun scientific context for what you'll be seeing on August 21st, start with Week 1 and move through the course week by week!

[Note: if you start with Week 1, you can skip through some of the repeated material once you get to Week 5.]

Overall this course will prepare you to... 

* Safely view the total or partial solar eclipse
* Help others watch safely and even make money by leading a “neighborhood watch” of the eclipse

Jacobi forms are holomorphic functions in two complex variables. They are modular in one variable and abelian (or double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985) which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions.
Motivated undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic” are enough).
The main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems.
For some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis.

However, it is the common financial statements that contain important information that provides inputs for valuation of investment projects. The only challenge is how to properly extract them.

Accounting and finance are indeed intertwined. Sometimes people that are not experienced in the area even mix them up. But most often emphasis in accounting is on numbers. Still, the deep understanding of key accounting concepts helps reveal the interests and actions of people behind these numbers. And the human dimension of accounting adds invaluable insight in the potential of successful project implementation.

This Course discusses core ideas and concepts of both financial and managerial accounting. It by no means pretends to be comprehensive to any extent. But, being rather an accounting overview, it focuses on the issues that are most relevant and important for effective valuation of investment projects.

The learners will gain insight into the essence of accounting. They will be able to use the obtained knowledge and skills to successfully advance in their career at a financial institution, as well as in the area of financial management at non-financial businesses.

Websites crash, calendar not synchronising, or even a power blackout. Of course you have! But did you know that many of these errors are the result of communication errors either within a system or between systems? Depending on the system, the impact of software failures can be huge, even resulting in massive economic damage or loss of lives. Software, and in particular the communication between software-intensive systems, is very complex and very difficult to get right. However, we _need_ dependability in the systems we use, directly or indirectly, to support us in our everyday lives.

System Validation helps you to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound. It also enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful; systems that are designed for sound behaviour are also much easier to maintain and adapt. System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. The techniques put forward in system validaton allow to prove the absence of errors. 

This first course ’Automata and behavioural equivalences', builds the foundation of the subsequent courses, showing you how to look at system behaviour as state machines. It discusses behavioural equivalences and illustrate these in a number of examples and quizzes. This course explains labelled transition systems or automata to model behaviour for especially software controlled systems. An important question is when two behaviours represented by such automata are equal. The answer to this question is not at all straightforward, but the resulting equivalences are used as powerful tools to simplify complex behaviour. This allows us to exactly investigate and understand the behavioural properties of such systems precisely. Especially, in the combination with hiding of behaviour, equivalence reduction is a unique technique to obtain insight in the behaviour of systems, far more effective than simulation or testing. Using this insight we can make the models correct. Such models form an excellent basis for the production of concise, reliable and maintainable software.

This course is part I of the set of courses for System Validation. System Validation, as a set of courses, is part of a larger EIT Digital online programme called 'Internet of Things through Embedded Systems'.",Created by:  EIT Digital ,"['Taught by:\xa0\xa0Jan Friso Groote, Full professor']",Rated 4 out of 5 of 51 ratings,See all 19 reviews,2018-05-30,"['Home', 'Computer Science', 'Design and Product']",System Validation: Automata and behavioural equivalences,https://www.coursera.org/learn/automata-system-validation

In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its co0nnection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and manmade. For most of history the manmade variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their ""surpassing disproportion"". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.  Best wishes and good luck!

In the first half of the course, we will compare two short biological sequences, such as genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or proteins.  We will encounter a powerful algorithmic tool called dynamic programming that will help us determine the number of mutations that have separated the two genes/proteins.

In the second half of the course, we will ""zoom out"" to compare entire genomes, where we see large scale mutations called genome rearrangements, seismic events that have heaved around large blocks of DNA over millions of years of evolution.  Looking at the human and mouse genomes, we will ask ourselves: just as earthquakes are much more likely to occur along fault lines, are there locations in our genome that are ""fragile"" and more susceptible to be broken as part of genome rearrangements?  We will see how combinatorial algorithms will help us answer this question.

ENGLISH VERSION

We have all probably played a video game at least once in our life, but... what's behind them? We can say that -no matter what game it is- there's a difficult multidisciplinary work that involves factors that go from the design to the video game's programming. This is an introductory course that will show you which aspects we must consider in the video game, and it will subsequently help you to individually study the different videogames creation's nucleus: design, art, video game engine and gameplay.

When you finish this introductory course, you will be able to identify, tell and explain the importance of the many aspects we must consider when designing a video game. We also want you to be able to avaluate which parts of a video game you're most interested in, so that you can later take the specific course on this topic -if you seek global knowledge you can see all the specialised program. Then you'll be ready to study more deeply these main topics -design, art, video game engine and gameplay- which are individually studied with detail during the other courses of the specialized program.

We use Excel to do our calculations, and all math formulas are given as Excel Spreadsheets, but we do not attempt to cover Excel Macros, Visual Basic, Pivot Tables, or other intermediate-to-advanced Excel functionality.

This course will prepare you to design and implement realistic predictive models based on data. In the Final Project (module 6) you will assume the role of a business data analyst for a bank, and develop two different predictive models to determine which applicants for credit cards should be accepted and which rejected. Your first model will focus on minimizing default risk, and your second on maximizing bank profits. The two models should demonstrate to you in a practical, hands-on way the idea that your choice of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model.

The second big idea this course seeks to demonstrate is that your data-analysis results cannot and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty. Your role as a data-analyst is to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers by a financially valuable increment, while quantifying how much uncertainty remains. You will learn to calculate and apply to real-world examples the most important uncertainty measures used in business, including classification error rates, entropy of information, and confidence intervals for linear regression.

All the data you need is provided within the course, all assignments are designed to be done in MS Excel, and you will learn enough Excel to complete all assignments. The course will give you enough practice with Excel to become fluent in its most commonly used business functions, and you’ll be ready to learn any other Excel functionality you might need in the future (module 1).

The course does not cover Visual Basic or Pivot Tables and you will not need them to complete the assignments. All advanced concepts are demonstrated in individual Excel spreadsheet templates that you can use to answer relevant questions.

We take a case-based approach to teach contemporary mathematical modeling
techniques. The course is appropriate for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Lectures provide biological background and describe the development of both classical mathematical models and more recent representations of biological processes. The course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments. The course should also be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct original research in modeling biological systems.

This course focuses on dynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research.  These techniques are based on biological mechanisms, and simulations with these models generate predictions that can subsequently be tested experimentally. These testable predictions frequently provide novel insight into biological processes. The approaches taught here can be grouped into the following categories: 1) ordinary differential equation-based models, 2) partial differential equation-based models, and 3) stochastic models.",Created by:  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"['Taught by:\xa0\xa0Eric Sobie, PhD, Associate Professor']",Rated 4.7 out of 5 of 109 ratings,See all 23 reviews,2018-05-30,"['Home', 'Life Sciences', 'Bioinformatics']",Dynamical Modeling Methods for Systems Biology,https://www.coursera.org/learn/dynamical-modeling

Over the course, students will be provided with a deep understanding of the mechanism underpinning the creation and/or development of a firm and the financial support it can get from the financial system through venture capital investment.

The course tries to discover how special financial intermediaries (called private equity investors) finance through equity companies belonging to different stages of their life-cycle, starting from the very beginning (startup and early stage) to a more mature phase (i.e. expansion, mature age, etc.) or also staying into crises and decline. 

Private equity (named venture capital when the company is in the first phases of its life cycle) deals with very different activities, such as scouting, advisory, deal-making, valuation, and financing as financial intermediaries see it. 

COURSE SYLLABUS
The course is made up of four different modules: 
WEEK 1 - Introduction to Private Equity and Venture Capital
WEEK 2 - Discovering Private Equity Investors: Legal Issues and Taxation
WEEK 3 - Management of Private Equity and Venture Capital Funds
WEEK 4 - Company Valuation And Deal Making In Private Equity Settings
WEEK 5 - Final Test
Throughout the course, guest speakers and practitioners will be interviewed to provide some examples of concrete applications of the contents presented.
